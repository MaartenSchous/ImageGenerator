# ImageGenerator
This PHP website allows a visitor to enter an image creation prompt. A C# evaluation tool facilitates approval and uploads to the gallery. It’s built with PHP, SQL and C# .net. It uses a local AI that runs in Docker to generate the images.

v0.1
This is a rebuild from my existing full and working project, this version is not complete.
Complete enough to add to my portfolio though.

The import from the webhost's database is not integrated in this version. (uploading works)
